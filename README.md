Currently working on...
- A very resdable stack ordiented language, [shelf](https://github.com/dungatoro/shelf).
- [Urynus](https://github.com/dungatoro/urynus), a handy tool for generating code from markdown code blocks. Different languages or projects can be configured differently to best fit your workflow.
