Currently working on...
- A very resdable stack ordiented language, [shelf](github.com/shelf).
- [Urynus](github.com/urynus), a highly configurable tool for generating code from markdown code blocks, as well as individual testing of code snippets. Different languages or projects can be configured differently to best fit your workflow.
